## Overview

Marlon James' grisly look into the Jamaican underworld was both a wonderful and tough read. At times
we felt confused by the dialect, the quick changes into different characters, and the sheer number of 
characters in the book. 

But some of the nuances that make the book great shine through after putting it down. We felt close to the
characters because James was able to "stream of consciousness" each of them with the grammar and diction of their 
thoughts. When you're reading Bam Bam's character, you really do feel like a coked out 13 year old. 

The references to music are clear. From Joel noticing an obscure reference to the BeeGees, to the obvious references to 
Bob Marley in the book. Music, and in general western influences, are a theme throughout the book. Case in point "Josey Wales".

This book made us think about all those movies that have receieved critical acclaim: City of God, Blood Diamond, etc... 
We expect a Hollywood exec will come a knocking (if he hasn't already).

It's an enlightening novel, it crosses the fiction/non-fiction line so easily that we really didn't know what was true and 
what wasn't. Although we all felt uncomfortable reading many parts of the book, overall we're happy we started out our first 
group read with this one.

### Favorite Characters

We were all over the place on this and for various reasons. But we enjoyed:

* Tristan Philips
* Papa-Lo
* Josey Wales
* Weeper

There were times we felt characters were either hard to enjoy (Nina Burgess/Dorcas Palmer) or 
they weren't expanded characters (Sir Arthur George Jennings)

### Geopolitics

Clearly the covert operations the CIA were running were thoroughly exposed in the book. We came away with more questions
than answers to US involvement in foreign policy. E.g. "Does the US make decisions to get involved in foreign countries
on some sliding scale?" or "Clearly the CIA was not in control of the Jamaican gangs, did they know this?"

### Views on Jamaica

We all came away with a completely different mindset about Jamaica, Jamaican culture and it's history. It's so much more 
about jerk chicken and Rasta. A impoverished, former colonial island, Jamaica is still figuring it's own identity. The stark contrast
between the rich tourists and the slum locals is clearly made in TBHOSK. Marley's discography takes on a new meaning after putting 
this book down. 

Rishad mentions that "sometimes to enact change, you have to be practical". So true. Papa, Josey, and to an extent the Singer, were 
all practical in their decisions. Morality was thrown out the door, in order to be change agent.

### Favorite Quote

Besides the numerous Jamaican patois that surfaces ("bombocloth"), Joel summarizes the entire book with this quote:

> God puts earth far away from heaven because even he can't stand the smell of dead flesh - Sir Arthur George Jennings
